                You can visit our Site without submitting any information that

                <strong>Web log data.</strong> When you use the Services, we
                automatically receive and record certain information from your
                computer (or other device) and your browser. This may include
                such data as your IP address and domain name, the pages you
                visit on the Services, the date and time of your visit, the
                files that you download, the URLs from the websites you visit
                before and after navigating to the Services, your software and
                hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general
                geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan
                region), and certain cookie information (see below). To obtain
                such information, we may use web logs or applications that
                recognize your computer and gather information about its online
                activity.

                <strong>Cookies.</strong> We use cookies on the Site. Cookies
                are small files that are stored on your computer by your web
                browser. A cookie allows the Site to recognize whether you have
                visited before and may store user preferences and other
                information. For example, cookies can be used to collect or
                store information about your use of the Site during your current
                session and over time (including the pages you view and the
                files you download), your computer&apos;s operating system and
                browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name
                and IP address, your general geographic location, the website
                that you visited before visiting the Site, and the link you used
                to leave the Site. If you are concerned about having cookies on
                your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or
                to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide
                whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your

                <strong>Web beacons.</strong> The Site or the emails that you
                receive from &AI may use an application known as a &quot;web
                beacon&quot; (also known as a &quot;clear gif&quot; or &quot;web
                bug&quot;). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually
                consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web
                page or in an email to transmit information, which could include
                personal information. For example, it can allow an email sender
                to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.

                example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web
                beacons on the Site or in email communications from us. This
                information may be used for a variety of purposes, as discussed
