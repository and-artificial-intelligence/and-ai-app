              Patent law is a discipline of dual masteryâ€”attorneys must
              understand both complex legal frameworks and the technical details
              of the inventions they&apos;re protecting. Until recently, it
              wasn&apos;t feasible to build solutions capable of understanding
              advanced topics ranging from semiconductor designs to
              pharmaceutical formulas. The paradigm has shifted, and AI has
              revolutionized what&apos;s possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, we&apos;re excited to share two significant updates for
              &AI: our $6.5M seed round led by First Round Capital, and the
              introduction of Andy, the first AI agent for patent attorneys.

                Professional-Grade AI for Patent Attorneys
              </h2>
              <p>
                At its core, &AI is professional-grade AI designed for patent
                attorneys. Our mission is to transform how attorneys work,
                providing powerful tools for end-to-end litigation workflows.
                We&apos;ve built a secure, collaborative platform to support
                attorneys with complex tasks like drafting claim charts,
                invalidity contentions, and prior art search.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike traditional AI assistants that simply follow
                instructions, Andy adapts dynamically to context, making
                intelligent decisions about how to best support attorneys in
                their work. We&apos;re confident that agentic AI will unlock new
                levels of productivity, allowing attorneys to focus on the
                strategic work that matters most.
