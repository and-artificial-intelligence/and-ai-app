## Hero Section

**H1:** Patent Invalidity Analysis

**Subheading:** From discovery to contentions—without switching tools.

**Value Proposition:** &AI is a collaborative workspace for patent invalidity work that produces trial-ready work product grounded in your case. Discover prior art, generate claim charts, and draft §102, §103, and §112 arguments—built around the way litigators actually work.

## The Invalidity Workflow

**Title:** Find the art. Map the claim. Draft the arguments.

**Description:** Invalidity work breaks down into the same loop every time. &AI keeps that loop in one place—so when strategy changes, you iterate instead of rebuilding.

**Features:**
- Find the best references
- Map limitations with clean citations
- Pressure-test §102 / §103 theories
- Address §112 vulnerabilities (written description / enablement)
- Draft contentions and supporting materials

---

## Claim Construction

**Title:** Define the terms. Control the case.

**Description:** Claim construction drives everything—invalidity, infringement, and settlement posture. Build Markman-ready constructions with a clear evidentiary record.

**Features:**
- Zero-in on disputed terms and generate draft definitions fast
- Ground each definition in intrinsic evidence first (claims, specification, prosecution history)
- Keep constructions 'live' as strategy evolves—so charts, analysis, and drafts stay consistent

---

## §102 — Single-Reference Theories

**Title:** §102 — Single-reference theories with pinpoint support

**Description:** §102 turns on whether the claim is anticipated under the statute's novelty framework.

**Features:**
- Isolate the exact limitation that makes or breaks the theory
- Collect pinpoint citations (not just 'close' passages)
- Maintain a clean trail from claim → evidence → draft

---

## §103 — Combination Theories

**Title:** §103 — Combination suggestions and charts that evolve with strategy

**Description:** §103 is a non-obviousness inquiry—often requiring combinations, motivations, and clean mapping across multiple references.

**Features:**
- Generate drafts for multiple references
- See coverage gaps early
- Propose §103 combinations and chart them before you invest time polishing

---

## §112 — Written Description and Enablement

**Title:** §112 — Surface vulnerabilities and draft around them

**Description:** §112(a) requires written description and enablement, and teams often need to evaluate whether the spec supports the full claim scope.

**Features:**
- Anchor analysis in the specification
- Flag weak support by limitation / claim scope
- Draft written description and enablement narratives faster

---

## Iterate, Don't Rebuild

**Title:** Discover better art. Build better theories. Draft faster.

**Description:** When positions change, you iterate instead of starting over. &AI is designed as a single repository so you can revise searches, charts, and drafts without restarting the entire pipeline.

**Features:**
- Trial-ready work product grounded in your case
- One workspace from discovery to contentions
- Iterate when strategy changes—without rebuilding

## FAQs

### What's the difference between a prior art search and invalidity analysis?
A prior art search focuses on finding relevant references, while invalidity analysis goes further by mapping those references to specific claim elements, constructing legal theories (§102/§103), and building the narrative for why a patent is invalid. &AI does both in one workflow.

### Can I build §103 combinations with motivation to combine?
Yes. Generate drafts for multiple references, see coverage gaps early, and propose §103 combinations—charting them before you invest time polishing.

### Do you support §112 written description and enablement analysis?
Yes. &AI helps you anchor analysis in the specification, flag weak support by limitation, and draft written description and enablement narratives faster.

### What deliverables do I get?
You receive invalidity claim charts with element-by-element mappings, §102/§103/§112 contentions, motivation to combine narratives, and all exports in Word format ready for filings or expert reports.
