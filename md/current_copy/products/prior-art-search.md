## Hero Section

**H1:** AI-Powered Prior Art Search

**Subheading:** Quality results in minutes, not days. Replace outside prior search firms.

**Value Proposition:** No more outsourcing to third-party search firms with a long wait time. Search for invalidating prior art and infringing products across patents, non-patent literature, and product documentation—across the internet—in minutes. &AI enables native multimodal searches optimized for what matters most—whether isolating specific limitations or reinforcing a §103 combination.

## Patents

**Title:** Search patent documents worldwide

**Description:** Patent applications and publications across major jurisdictions—built to iterate fast when the claim language changes. Results come back with relevance summaries and citations to key disclosures.

**Features:**
- US and international patents
- Applications and publications
- Fast iteration when claim language changes

## Non-Patent Literature

**Title:** Find invalidating art in NPL

**Description:** Research papers, standards, clinical trials, and more across the public internet—where the best invalidating art often lives.

**Features:**

- Technical standards
- US clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- Archived web (Wayback Machine)

- Keep the full trail when you need to explain why these are the best references

## FAQs

### Does this replace a prior art search firm?
That's the point. &AI is built to let teams run firm-grade searches internally—faster iteration, broader sources, and outputs you can actually use.

### What sources do you search?
Patents, non-patent literature, and products—including standards/clinical trials and archival product materials.

### Can you use archived web pages (Wayback) in a search workflow?
Yes—especially when a key disclosure was later edited or removed. The Wayback Machine supports URL lookup and date-range selection for captures.

### What is ClinicalTrials.gov?
A public website and online database of clinical research studies and results maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
