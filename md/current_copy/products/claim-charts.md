## Hero Section

**H1:** Litigation-Ready Claim Charts

**Subheading:** Win cases faster with trial-ready analysis.

**Value Proposition:** Claim charting follows a familiar routine: pull the patent, pull the prior art or product materials, open Word, build a table. Copy each limitation into the left column. Hunt for evidence. Paste. Format citations. Repeat. And when litigation strategy changes midstream, too much of that work starts over. &AI built Charts to shorten that loop—without taking control away from you. Generate precise invalidity or evidence-of-use claim charts in minutes instead of days.

## Claims and Elements

**Title:** Element-by-element charts with citations

**Description:** Charts produces element-by-element claim charts with citations to prior art and product documentation. Charts are composed entirely of citations and produced in a trial-ready format—so all you have to do is review, edit, and export.

**Features:**
- Limitation-by-limitation mapping
- Pinpoint citations to source material
- Trial-ready formatting

## Claim Construction

**Title:** Use construction from day one

**Description:** Charts is informed by a detailed claim construction. Constructions are generated from the as-filed application, prosecution history, related family, and more.

**Features:**
- Tighten disputed terms before mapping evidence
- Preserve consistency across drafts and exports
- Keep the record in view as positions evolve

---

## Invalidity Charts

**Title:** Built for §102, §103, and §112 workflows

**Description:** Charts supports invalidity charting in the way litigation teams actually work.

**Features:**
- §102 charts (anticipation / single-reference mapping)
- §103 charts (combination-ready mapping as theories develop)
- §112 support (spec grounding and clarity gaps where relevant)

## Evidence of Use Charts

**Title:** Map claims to real products—fast

**Description:** Generate evidence-of-use charts against product materials such as specs, manuals, teardowns, screenshots, and video—then refine with search across everything you've uploaded.

**Features:**
- Product specs and manuals
- Teardowns and screenshots
- Video and marketing materials

## Compare References

**Title:** Pick the strongest reference before you polish

**Description:** Instead of committing to one reference and discovering gaps late, create first-draft charts for multiple candidates and quickly see which elements are strongest.

**Features:**
- Which elements are strongest per reference
- Where the gaps are
- Whether a §103 combination is more efficient than forcing a weak single reference

**Features:**
- First-pass accuracy: 89% similarity to final export
- Designed for expert review and iteration
- Full audit trails for defensibility

## FAQs

### Can I request a free sample claim chart?
Yes—send a patent and one or more references (prior art or product materials). We'll return a first-draft export so you can validate citations, mapping quality, and formatting.

### Do you support claim construction and prosecution history?
Yes—Charts uses claim constructions generated from the as-filed application, prosecution history, related family, and more.

### What kinds of charts can I generate?
Invalidity (including §102/§103/§112 support) and evidence-of-use charts are core, and the workflow is designed for litigation-ready exports.

### Do I stay in control of what gets exported?
Yes—Charts is built for review, editing, and export. You control what goes out.
