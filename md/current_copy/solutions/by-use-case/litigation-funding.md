## Metadata

**Title:** Litigation Funding | Source and Underwrite Patent Cases Faster | &AI

**Description:** Discover patent litigation opportunities at scale and accelerate underwriting: prior art + claim charts + product evidence + structured diligence in one workflow. Built for non-recourse litigation finance.

---

## Hero Section

**Badge:** Use Case

**H1:** Litigation Funding

**Subheading:** Discover opportunities at scale. Underwrite faster. Move first.

**Description:** Litigation finance is typically non-recourse—funders get repaid only from case proceeds, and if the case loses, repayment is generally not owed. That makes diligence everything: the best funds win by sourcing better matters and underwriting faster without losing rigor.

## Challenges

- Sourcing better matters requires monitoring at scale
- Underwriting requires quickly evaluating legal merits, expected duration, damages, and collectability
- Non-recourse funding models make diligence quality critical
- Deal flow is limited by diligence capacity—not capital

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Opportunities
A feed designed for 'is this worth funding?' Personalized, real-time feed of new filings and litigation signals—built to help teams surface pitch-worthy matters quickly and route them to the right reviewer.

### 2. Tables
Portfolio-scale screening before you spend hours charting. Analyze large sets of documents consistently—screen complaints, exhibits, and diligence binders at scale, extract structured fields, and filter to the highest-signal matters.

### 3. Prior Art Search
Pressure-test validity early. A lot of underwriting time goes into answering: is this patent strong enough to carry the case? Move quickly from 'interesting' to 'investable' by accelerating prior art discovery.

### 4. Product Search
Validate infringement evidence with real product materials. Diligence often depends on what's publicly documented: manuals, specs, release notes, developer docs, teardowns, and video.

### 5. Claim Charts
Litigation-ready mapping with citations. Draft invalidity charts (single reference and combinations) and evidence-of-use charts grounded in product evidence.

### 6. Drafts
Investment memos and diligence summaries—done faster. Underwriting memo sections (merits/risks, timelines, damages frame), diligence summaries for IC review, and outreach materials.
