## Metadata

**Title:** Infringement Mining & Evidence-of-Use Search | Find Infringers Faster | &AI

**Description:** Run infringement mining at scale: search product documentation across the web, use Tables to analyze thousands of documents, and generate evidence-of-use claim charts with citations for licensing and litigation.

## Hero Section

**Badge:** Use Case

**H1:** Infringement Mining

**Subheading:** Evidence-of-use search at scale—without drowning in documents.

**Description:** Infringement mining (often called an evidence-of-use search or patent infringement search) is the process of identifying potentially infringing products/services and collecting supporting evidence for enforcement, licensing, or diligence. &AI compresses the workflow into one system: Tables → Product Search → Evidence-of-Use Claim Charts → Drafts.

## Challenges

- Too many targets to evaluate manually
- Product evidence scattered across manuals, specs, release notes, and marketing pages
- EoU mapping is slow and repetitive (copy, paste, cite, format, repeat)
- Work gets redone when you change targets or theories

---

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Define the claims/features you care about
Start with the patent claims and key features you want to find in the market. This focuses your search and makes downstream charting more efficient.

### 2. Product Search
Product documentation across the web—when it matters most. Find manuals, spec sheets, developer docs, release notes, teardowns, and other product materials. Confirm whether a feature exists and where it's documented.

### 3. Tables
An AI-powered spreadsheet for infringement mining. Screen many products quickly ('which ones implement X?'), extract structured fields (feature present, version, evidence snippet, URL), and filter down to the few targets worth full EoU charting.

### 4. Evidence-of-Use (EOU) Claim Charts
Turn 'suspected overlap' into litigation-grade mapping. An EoU chart maps claim elements to features in an allegedly infringing product—connecting claim language to real-world evidence with pinpoint citations.

### 5. Drafts
From mining to outreach, licensing, and filings. Build licensing outreach packages, draft memos and internal diligence summaries, and support complaints and infringement contentions.

## FAQs

### What is infringement mining?
Infringement mining is the process of identifying likely infringing products/services and collecting supporting evidence—often via an evidence-of-use (EoU) search—before investing in full charting and enforcement.

### What is an evidence-of-use claim chart?
An EoU claim chart maps each claim element to corresponding product evidence to evaluate infringement or non-infringement.

### Why is product documentation important for infringement detection?
Because the cleanest early infringement theories usually come from citable sources like manuals, specs, release notes, and technical documentation.
