## Hero Section

**Badge:** Use Case

**H1:** Plaintiff-Side Litigation

**Subheading:** Find infringers faster. Build the EOU. Draft the case.

**Description:** Plaintiff-side litigation is a speed game: identify the right products, assemble clean evidence, and turn it into work product your team can file and defend. &AI supports the plaintiff workflow end-to-end: Product Search → Evidence-of-Use Charts → Drafts.

## Challenges

- Most plaintiff workflows start too narrow—missing potential targets
- Product evidence is scattered across manuals, specs, release notes, and marketing pages
- EoU mapping is slow and repetitive (copy, paste, cite, format, repeat)
- Work gets redone when you change targets or theories

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Infringement mining and detection
Expand the funnel beyond 'known suspects.' Mine for targets at scale by surfacing relevant product evidence across the web—then narrow quickly to what's chartable.

### 2. Product Search
Search the public footprint of products: manuals, spec sheets, developer docs, marketing pages, release notes, teardowns, and video. Keep what matters in one project so your evidence doesn't evaporate when pages change.

### 3. Evidence-of-Use (EOU) Claim Charts
Element-by-element mapping with pinpoint citations. Generate a first-draft EOU chart in minutes, review and control what makes it into the export, iterate quickly as targets or theories change.

### 4. Drafts
From evidence to filings and outreach. Turn project evidence into licensing outreach, complaints, infringement contentions, and supporting memos—without starting from blank pages each time.

## FAQs

### What is infringement mining?
Infringement mining is the process of scanning products and documentation to identify likely infringers and prioritize which targets merit full evidence-of-use charting.

### What is an evidence-of-use (EOU) claim chart?
An EOU claim chart maps each claim element to supporting product evidence (often in a table) to assess infringement or non-infringement.

### Why does product documentation matter for plaintiff-side cases?
Because the strongest early infringement theories usually rely on clear, citable disclosures in manuals, specs, developer docs, and other product materials.
