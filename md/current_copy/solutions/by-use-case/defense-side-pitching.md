## Challenges

- Docket monitoring is necessary, but pitching is the hard part
- Defense teams lose time stitching together: case signal → relevance → partner match → outreach content → deck formatting
- Traditional tools provide filings but don't finish the job
- First-mover advantage goes to whoever can act fastest

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Opportunities
Personalized opportunities feed, not a generic report. Built to answer one question quickly: 'Is this worth pitching?' Use a feed designed for defense-side BD triage—paired with notifications so your team can act quickly.

### 2. Team matching
Route matters to the right partner instantly. Defense BD isn't just finding a case—it's choosing who should reach out. Opportunities supports team evaluation so one person can scan and triage, while the right partner gets the right case context.

### 3. Pitch Decks
Complaint-to-pitch deck in one workflow. Upload a complaint, select a template, choose depth, and generate a polished pitch package—purpose-built around litigation intake.

### 4. Drafts
Generate the outreach materials your team actually sends. Templates and collaborative editing for pitch letters, client emails, and longer-form pitch memos—grounded in the case context.

## FAQs

### What is 'defense-side pitching' in patent litigation?
Defense-side pitching is the business development workflow of identifying new patent cases worth pursuing and reaching potential defendants quickly with a credible pitch.

### How is this different from PACER or generic docket alerts?
PACER provides electronic public access to federal court records; docket alerts and current awareness products summarize and notify. &AI adds personalization, team matching, and complaint-to-pitch drafting to execute the outreach faster.

### Is this 'law firm BD automation'?
Yes—Opportunities helps teams discover and triage pitch-worthy matters, and Drafts/Pitch Decks generate the outreach materials so teams can act without rebuilding the same pitch workflow every time.

### Can &AI generate a pitch deck from a complaint?
That's the complaint-to-pitch deck workflow: upload the complaint, choose a template, and generate a draft pitch package that your team can refine.
