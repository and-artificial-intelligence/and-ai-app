## Section 1: Personalized Case Feed

**H2:**

```
Patent Filings Filtered to What's Actually Relevant
```

**Description:**

```
Docket monitoring tools are broad by design—useful for tracking, but noisy for client development. Opportunities filters the daily stream of filings to cases that align with your team's technical experience, venue history, and the types of matters you actually take on.
```

**Feature List:**

- Exclude case types you don't pursue (Schedule A, Hatch-Waxman, declaratory judgment actions)
- Include or exclude specific parties
- Recommendations based on attorney bios and prior case experience

**Data Source Callout (builds credibility):**

```
Where the data comes from: Opportunities draws from attorney bios you provide, publicly available docket records, and any prior case data you choose to upload. Your firm's data stays with your firm—matching criteria and client lists are not shared or visible to other users.
```

---

## Section 2: Real-Time Filing Alerts

**H2:**

```
Know About Relevant Filings Minutes After They Hit the Docket
```

**Description:**

```
Alerts can fire as soon as five minutes after a case is filed. Set thresholds based on match strength, or get notified whenever a party you track is named as a defendant. No waiting for a daily digest.
```

**Feature List:**

- Alerts based on match score or party name
- Configurable thresholds (so you're not buried in noise)
- Notifications via email or in-app

---

## Section 3: Attorney-to-Case Matching

**H2:**

```
See Which Attorneys Have the Strongest Fit
```

**Description:**

```
For every filing, Opportunities evaluates fit against your team's experience—technical background, prior defense work in the relevant technology, venue familiarity, and case complexity. The goal isn't to tell you who should pitch. It's to surface the information so you can staff the pitch intelligently.
```

**Match Factors:**

- Technical alignment (patent subject matter vs. attorney experience)
- Prior defense work in the technology area
- Venue and forum experience
- Case complexity

**Team Callout:**

```
For teams: If multiple attorneys are a fit, you'll see that. One person can triage filings for the group and route cases to the right attorney.
```

---

## Section 4: Case Intelligence

**H2:**

```
The Context You Need to Evaluate a Case—Without the Research
```

**Description:**

```
Each filing includes a case overview built from the complaint, patent records, and party data. You'll see what's asserted, what's accused, who the parties are, and whether anyone on your team has a connection worth leveraging.
```

**Included in Each Case:**

- Summary of the complaint with asserted patents and accused instrumentalities
- Links to source documents
- LinkedIn connections to in-house counsel or party contacts (surfacing connections you might have missed—not replacing the ones you already have)

---

## Section 5: Patent and Party Intelligence

**H2:**

```
Patent Assertion History and Party Litigation Patterns
```

**Description:**

```
Before you reach out, understand what you're walking into. See how many times a patent has been asserted, in which venues, and how those cases resolved. Surface patterns in party behavior—settlement tendencies, typical case duration, litigation posture.
```

**Intelligence Includes:**

- Patent assertion history across venues and outcomes
- Party settlement rates
- Typical case duration and resolution patterns
- Venue preferences

**Credibility Callout:**

```
This is the diligence that takes hours to compile manually. It's here when you need it.
```

## Section 6: From Filing to Pitch Letter

**H2:**

```
Draft a Case-Specific Pitch Letter—Without Starting from Scratch
```

**Description:**

```
When the fit is right, you can generate a first draft of a pitch letter directly from the filing. The draft pulls in relevant case facts, your team's applicable experience, and patent/party context. It's a starting point—not a finished product. You add the substance and angle; the tool handles the assembly.
```

**What This Is:**

- A first pass that saves formatting and research time
- Customizable to your firm's format (letter, memo, or short assessment)
- A way to move quickly when speed matters

**What This Isn't:**

- A replacement for case-specific judgment
- Generic boilerplate (the draft is tied to this filing, this technology, this party)

---

## Section 7: Accuracy and Data Quality

**H2:**

```
Built to Reduce Noise, Not Add to It
```

**Description:**

```
A tool that floods you with irrelevant cases is worse than no tool at all. Opportunities is designed to surface fewer, higher-quality matches—not to maximize volume. Match thresholds are adjustable, and the system learns from your feedback over time.
```

**Credibility Callout:**

```
If you're seeing too many false positives, something is misconfigured. We'll help you fix it.
```

---

## Section 8: Who This Is For (AEO-friendly)

Built for Defense-Side Patent Litigation Teams
```

**Description:**

```
Opportunities is designed for:
```

- Patent litigation partners and associates evaluating new defense opportunities
- Practice group leaders managing case flow across a team
- Client development professionals supporting patent litigation groups

**Callout:**

```
It's not a general docket research tool. It's focused on one workflow: identifying cases worth pursuing and moving on them efficiently.
```
